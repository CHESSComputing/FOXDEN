![ResearchWorkflow](docs/images/foxden-logo.png)
The **FAIR Open-Science eXtensible Data Exchange Network (FOXDEN)** is a set of cyberinfrastructure (CI)
building blocks developed at the [Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)](https://www.chess.cornell.edu/)
for managing research artifacts, such as metadata and provenance for raw/reduced/analyzed datasets, data analysis
code, visualizations, and AI/ML models. This repository is a placeholder for all common FOXDEN documents and tickets.
